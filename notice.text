This is the messages I got after running pod install or pod update:

[!] CocoaPods did not set the base configuration of your project because your project already has a custom config set. In order for CocoaPods integration to work at all, please either set the base configurations of the target `Runner` to `Target Support Files/Pods-Runner/Pods-Runner.debug-staging.xcconfig` or include the `Target Support Files/Pods-Runner/Pods-Runner.debug-staging.xcconfig` in your build configuration (`Flutter/Debug.xcconfig`).

[!] CocoaPods did not set the base configuration of your project because your project already has a custom config set. In order for CocoaPods integration to work at all, please either set the base configurations of the target `Runner` to `Target Support Files/Pods-Runner/Pods-Runner.release-staging.xcconfig` or include the `Target Support Files/Pods-Runner/Pods-Runner.release-staging.xcconfig` in your build configuration (`Flutter/Release.xcconfig`).

[!] CocoaPods did not set the base configuration of your project because your project already has a custom config set. In order for CocoaPods integration to work at all, please either set the base configurations of the target `Runner` to `Target Support Files/Pods-Runner/Pods-Runner.profile-staging.xcconfig` or include the `Target Support Files/Pods-Runner/Pods-Runner.profile-staging.xcconfig` in your build configuration (`Flutter/Release.xcconfig`).
This is what I did to solve the issue:

Add Schemes to Podfile under project 'Runner'

project 'Runner', {
  'Debug' => :debug,
  'Debug-staging' => :debug,
  'Profile' => :release,
  'Profile-staging' => :release,
  'Release' => :release,
  'Release-staging' => :release,
}
Go to ios/Flutter/Debug.xcconfig and include

#include "Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-Runner/Pods-Runner.debug-staging.xcconfig"
Go to ios/Flutter/Release.xcconfig and include

#include "Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-Runner/Pods-Runner.release-staging.xcconfig"
#include "Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-Runner/Pods-Runner.profile-staging.xcconfig"
flutter clean
Delete podfile.lock
Pub get
pod install
